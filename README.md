# 👋 Hi there

🎓 I am Oussama Guelfaa, a Master’s student in Computer Science at École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Saint-Étienne. I am passionate about technology and eager to contribute to innovative solutions. My background includes expertise in Software Engineering, Cybersecurity, and Operational Research.

👨‍💻 My technical journey includes diverse projects such as developing an automated Forex trading algorithm and optimizing software systems. I enjoy working with Python, Java, and C++, tackling challenges in database management and system design.

🌟 Beyond academics, I thrive in leadership roles. As an Event Manager for the International Students Association, I’ve facilitated events for over 100 students, emphasizing inclusivity and cultural diversity. My Citizen Project contributions range from web design to organizing impactful community events.

🏆 I am multilingual, fluent in Arabic, French, and English, with beginner proficiency in Spanish. I also bring skills in Python, SQL, Linux, and VBA, always ready to expand my expertise.

🎾 Outside tech, I enjoy tennis, football, and exploring Moroccan cuisine. I find commerce and politics equally fascinating and love to engage in meaningful discussions.

✈️ As someone who values cultural exchange, I’m always eager to connect and collaborate. Check out my LinkedIn profile to know more!
